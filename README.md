TECHNOLOGY USED


The "Hotel Administration System" is developed using a robust technology stack to ensure efficiency, reliability, and scalability.

JAVA: 

Java is the core programming language utilized in the development of the Hotel Administration System. Known for its platform independence and object-oriented nature, Java provides a solid foundation for building complex and secure applications. It offers a rich set of libraries and frameworks that expedite development and enable seamless integration with various components of the system.

AWT & Swing: 

For creating an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), the system employs AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing. These GUI toolkit provide a wide range of components and layouts that enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application. With AWT and Swing, the Hotel Administration System offers a consistent and interactive interface to hotel staff and administrators.

MYSQL:

 The Hotel Administration System utilizes the MYSQL database management system for efficient storage and retrieval of data. MYSQL is renowned for its high performance, reliability, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for managing transaction records, customer details, room information, and billing data.

Apache Net Beans:

 Apache NetBeans serves as the integrated development environment (IDE) for coding the project. This powerful IDE provides essential tools, debugging capabilities, and code analysis features, streamlining the development process and ensuring code quality.


JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): 

JDBC enables seamless connectivity between the Java application and the MYSQL database. It allows the Hotel Administration System to interact with the database, retrieve data, and execute queries efficiently.
